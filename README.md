# SoundCloud Clone App => tới SEO Robot.txt (tạm ngưng)

A full-stack music streaming application built with modern web technologies, featuring Next.js 14 frontend and NestJS backend.

## 📝 Description (Updated)

This project includes Next.js 14 with Server Actions support. Next.js is a JavaScript framework specialized for frontend development, with built-in React library integration for efficient UI development. The advantage of Next.js over pure React is providing a framework structure that solves common React issues we previously handled manually, such as routing, nested routes, etc.

Additionally, with server-side advantages, Next.js can pre-render interfaces, helping websites load faster and providing SEO benefits compared to traditional React client-side rendering.

In this project, you'll learn the latest Next.js features from scratch (using TypeScript) through a practical SoundCloud clone website.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. Main Project Features:

- **Authentication**: Support for Google/GitHub login and local backend account login. Capable of supporting login with various platforms listed at: https://next-auth.js.org/providers/

- **Music Playback**:
  - Audio track in footer
  - Audio as waveform/wavetrack for detailed view (clone of SoundCloud concept)

- **Interactive Features**:
  - Time-based comments displayed on wavetrack
  - Create playlists/Like tracks
  - Search/Find tracks by display name

- **Admin Interface**: CRUD operations for users/tracks/comments...

### 2. Technology Stack

#### Frontend:
- **Client**: Next.js, MUI (TypeScript). Login with Next-auth (supports Google/GitHub login and Credential Provider from backend)
- **Admin**: Vite, Antd (TypeScript)

#### Backend:
- **NestJS** (provided)

## 🚀 Technologies & Learning Objectives

### React Knowledge (TypeScript with Vite)
Beyond basic knowledge, additional topics covered:
- React Children, React Fragment, React Context
- Suspense/Lazy loading
- Hooks: useRef, useCallback, useMemo

### Next.js Knowledge
- **Next.js 13 with App Router** (TypeScript)
- Master the changes in Next.js 13 compared to older versions (breaking changes):
  - **Routing** (dynamic routes, route groups)
  - **Data Fetching** (Server component vs Client component with "use client")
  - **Authentication** with Next-auth (using Session/JWT/Refresh Token)
  - **SEO** (basic level, testing with built-in lighthouse extension)
  - **Rendering**: Client Side Rendering (CSR), Server Side Rendering (SSR), Static Site Generation (SSG), Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)

### End of Course Updates
- **Next.js 14 Upgrade** guide and Server Actions usage
- **Build Mode**:
  - Build application with Docker
  - Update interface after build (with revalidateTag)
- **MUI** for base components
